# Direct Digital Synthesis Function generator
This function generator can sysnthesis sine wave signal that has frequency between 50 to 200kHz while able to maintain range of Vpp between 1Vpp to 10 Vpp  moreover can adjust dc offset +-5v and Total Harmonic Distortion of generate sine wave signal is less than 5%.
